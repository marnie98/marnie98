- 👋 Hi, I’m @marnie98
- 👀 I’m interested in translation and proof-reading!
- 🌱 I’m currently graduating from university to become a fully certified translator although I've been doing this for years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects, dubbing, subtitles, helping in general :)
- 📫 Hit me on twitter (mahmoraes98) or facebook(/marcelademoraes), I am currently an intern during the day and a student during the night, but I'm always trying to be available!
